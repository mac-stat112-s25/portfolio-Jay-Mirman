Each + is at the end of a line, and tells the code that there is another line of code to look for\nMy assumption is that ‘geom’ stands for geometry, and ‘geam_bar’ is telling ggplot to add a bar plot’s geometry\n‘labs’ likely stands for labels\n‘color’ sets the border color of the bar where as ‘fill’ fills the bar with a color\n\nPart b\n\nObserved Categories: Rating Difficult Easy Moderate Variability between categories: Some categories do appear to be more common than others. For example, moderate has nearly triple the amount of observations as difficult\nWe learned that the ratings of the peaks are not evenly distributed. It appears that moderate ratings are most common, followed distantly by easy, with difficult being close behind easy.\n\nPart c\n\nI would like to be able to order the x axis.

Any value from 3900 to 4900 feet appears typical, but hikes at heights less than 3900 feet and greater than 4900 feet do appear to be common enough to not be considered outliers\nThe height of each of the hikes has a spread of 1300 feet from 3700 feet to 5500 feet\nThe values appear distributed with a slightly right skewed\nThere does not appear to be any outcomes that are unusually large or small\n\nExercise 8\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

This appears the same as the histogram we looked at in an earlier exercise\n\n\nExercise 10\n\n\ngeom_histogram()\n\n\nColor adds a border to each bin where as fill adds a fill color to each bin\n\n\nadding ‘color = “white”’ improves the visualization as it makes it much more readable with the spaces between bins\n\n\nbinwidth changes how wide the range in elevation each bin contains\n\n\nthe histogram becomes ineffective because it becomes impossible to assertain meaningful information about the data. We become unable to effectively see the center, and the large bins mean that the true spread also becomes difficult to see\n\n\nthe histogram becomes ineffective because the small bins make the histogram unreadable. it is hard to assertain the center because there are too many small data points\n\n\nExercise 11\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_density(color = “blue”)\n\nchanges the line to be blue\n\ngeom_density(fill = “orange”)\n\nchanges the area below the line to be orange\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was correct\n\n\nThe density plot appears similar to the histogram, but makes it easier to see the shape of the data\n\n\nExercise 12\n\n\nHistogram Easy to see the center Easy to see the spread\n\n\nDensity Easy to see the center Easy to see the shape\n\n\nExercise 13\n\n\nAdding indentations makes the code more readable\n\n\nit makes the code readable\n\n\nExercise 14\n\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nhead(survey)\n\n         cafe_mac minutes_to_campus fav_temp_c       hangout\n1 mashed potatoes                 5         26 the mountains\n2        is tasty                 5         28        a city\n3          burger                 5         19      a forest\n4    caesar salad                12         18      a forest\n5       ice cream                 0         24 the mountains\n6           tofu                 10        -10 the mountains\n\nhead(world_cup)\n\n  year        host       winner         second   third       fourth\n1 1930     Uruguay      Uruguay      Argentina     USA   Yugoslavia\n2 1934       Italy        Italy Czechoslovakia Germany      Austria\n3 1938      France        Italy        Hungary  Brazil       Sweden\n4 1950      Brazil      Uruguay         Brazil  Sweden        Spain\n5 1954 Switzerland West Germany        Hungary Austria      Uruguay\n6 1958      Sweden       Brazil         Sweden  France West Germany\n  goals_scored teams games attendance\n1           70    13    18     434000\n2           70    16    17     395000\n3           84    15    18     483000\n4           88    13    22    1337000\n5          140    16    26     943000\n6          126    16    35     868000\n\n\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = minutes_to_campus)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = fav_temp_c)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(world_cup, aes(x = goals_scored)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(world_cup, aes(x = winner)) +\n  geom_bar()",

A few notable ones are in Texas, where the repub_pct increased a large amount in the 4 years.\n\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart A\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the median rent scatterplot, there is a moderately strong negative relationship between repub_pct_20 and median_rent.\nFor the median age scatterplot, there is a moderately strong posive relationship between repub_pct_20 and median_age.\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatterplot is not the best visualization here, because it fails to effectively show data. Because it compresses all the categorical data into 1 line, it becomes very difficult to see center.\n-Exercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that historical red counties centered around a higher repub_pct_20, where as blue counties center around a lower repub_pct_20. Purple counties are in between the two. There appear to be alot of outliers for historical red and purple counties with a couple outiers in historically blue counties as well. Interestingly, there are only outliers with a lower repub_pct_20 value.\n\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\n\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#some of the data covers up other parts of the data.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#This is terrible because it is hard to read the count for blue and purple, because they are not lined up at 0\n\n\nExercise 10\n\nI like density plots the best\nDensity plots give more accurate knowlege of the shape of the data\nBox plots give more accurate knowlege of the center of the data\n\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical,fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\n\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#historical describes what each bar contains, where as winner_20 seperates out each bar into a portion for dem and for repub\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart A\n\nA pro is that it gives a more accurate way to determine the percentage of each historical group winner_20 A con is that it does not give a count of all the counties in each bar\n\nPart B\n\nMy favorite is the staked Bar plot. I feel that it gives a good comprimise for displaying the number of counts and the proportion of counts\n\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) \n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\nweather %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = temp9am, y = temp3pm))+\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = raintoday)) +\n  geom_bar()",
